	An imaginary Bank (AFFLUENT BANK) has a large amount of data about their customers.
	The marketing team at the bank wanted to launch a targeted ad marketing campaign by dividing their customers into at least three distinctive groups.
	In this case study we are performing Data preparation, cleaning, an Exploratory Data Analysis, Data visualization (using, histogram, KDE plot etc.) and all necessary things to find insights from the Dataset.
	Application of Elbow method (K-Means clustering) to find the optimal number of clusters.
	Application of K-Means clustering from scikit-learn to perform market segmentation.
	Application of AUTOENCODERS model for dimensionality reduction using Keras.
	Apply PCA (principal component Analysis) to perform dimensionality reduction using real world data set to support marketing team for their successful campaign.
